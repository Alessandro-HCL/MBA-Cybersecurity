## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains the capstone project developed during my **MBA in Cybersecurity & Networking**, successfully defended and approved in 2025.  
The project integrates **Red Team offensive simulations**, **Blue Team defensive monitoring**, and **AI-based anomaly detection** into a modular and replicable framework.  

The system was designed to support:
- **Cybersecurity training and audits**  
- **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) network due diligence**  
- **Corporate resilience testing**  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
The framework is structured into three main modules:

1. **Red Team (Attack Simulation)**  
   - Generates controlled network attacks (IP Spoofing, SYN Flood, DNS Tunneling, TLS Handshake Incomplete).  
   - Executed via Python scripts and hping3 in a Kali Linux environment.  

2. **Blue Team (Traffic Capture & Analysis)**  
   - Uses Wireshark/tshark and Scapy to capture and parse network packets.  
   - Identifies anomalies based on traffic volume, TTL changes, fragmentation, and unusual headers.  

3. **AI/ML Detection**  
   - Implements an **Isolation Forest** model for anomaly detection.  
   - Achieved **>90% accuracy** distinguishing legitimate vs. malicious traffic in controlled tests.  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Implementation Environment
- **Kali Linux VM** (attack execution)  
- **Windows Host with Wireshark/tshark** (traffic capture)  
- **Python (Scapy, Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib)**  
- **Streamlit (optional interface prototype)**  

---

## üìä Results
- Successfully simulated multiple Layer 3 and Layer 7 attacks.  
- Blue Team module correctly flagged anomalies such as spoofed IPs, abnormal user-agents, and incomplete TLS handshakes.  
- Machine Learning model reached **high accuracy in predictive detection**, confirming the potential for enterprise use.  

---

## üöÄ Roadmap (Next Steps)
1. Expand dataset with real corporate network traffic.  
2. Integrate with **SIEM/SOAR tools** for automated response.  
3. Pilot implementation in **M&A due diligence projects** to reduce risk of downtime and cyber incidents.  
4. Extend framework to **critical sectors** (healthcare, finance, logistics).
