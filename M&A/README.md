# M&A Project Core

This folder contains the **main project** of the Cybersecurity Simulation and Predictive Detection Framework.

### Structure:
- `Menu.py` → Main menu to navigate between modules.  
- `Red_team_ataque_OKAY.py` → Offensive attack simulations.  
- `Blue_team_detecção_OKAY.py` → Passive network traffic detection.  
- `Coleta_dados_OKAY.py` → Network data collection for inventory.  
- `M&A_análise_OKAY.py` → Analysis module focused on M&A (inventory, EoL/EoS checks).  
- `docs/` → Reports, academic validation, and supporting evidence.  

This is the **core deliverable** of the project.
